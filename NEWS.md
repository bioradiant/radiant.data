# CHANGES IN radiant.data 0.0.0.9000

Modified version for learning and testing.

# CHANGES IN radiant.data 0.8.4

## NEW FEATURES

* Export `ggplotly` from `plotly` for interactive plots in _R > Report_
* Export `subplot` from `plotly` for grids of interactive plots in _R > Report_
* Set default `res = 96` for `renderPlot` and `dpi = 96` for `knitr::opts_chunk`
* Add `fillcol`, `linecol`, and `pointcol` to `visualize` to set plot colors when no `fill` or `color` variable has been selected
* Reverse legend ordering in _Data > Visualize_ when axes are flipped using `coor_flip()`

## BUG FIXES

* Chi-sqaure results were not displayed correctly in _Data > Pivot_

# CHANGES IN radiant.data 0.8.1

## NEW FEATURES

- Specify the maximum number of rows to load for a csv and csv (url) file through _Data > Manage_
- Support for loading and saving feather files, including specifying the maximum number of rows to load through _Data > Manage_
- Added author and year arguments to help modals in inst/app/radiant.R (thanks @kmezhoud)
- Added size argument for scatter plots to create bubble charts (thanks @andrewsali)
- Example and CSS formatting for tables in _R > Report_
- Added `seed` argument to `make_train`
- Added `prop`, `sdprop`, etc. for working with proportions
- Set `ylim` in `visualize` for multiple plots
- Show progress indicator when saving reports from _R > Report_
- `copy_attr` convenience function
- `refactor` function to keep only a subset of levels in a factor and recode the remaining (and first) level to, for example, other
- `register` function to add a (transformed) dataset to the dataset dropdown
- Remember name of state files loaded and suggest that name when re-saving the state
- Show dataset name in output if dataframe passed directly to analysis function
- R-notebooks are now the default option for output saved from _R > Report_ and _R > Code_
- Improved documentation on how to customize plots in _R > Report_
- Keyboard short-cut to put code into _R > Report_ (ALT-enter)

## BUG FIXES

- When clicking the `rename` button, without changing the name, the dataset was set to NULL (thanks @kmezhoud, https://github.com/radiant-rstats/radiant/issues/5)
- Replace ext with .ext in `mutate_each` function call
- Variance estimation in Data > Explore would cause an error with unit cell-frequencies (thanks @kmezhoud, https://github.com/radiant-rstats/radiant/issues/6)
- Fix for as_integer when factor levels are characters
- Fix for integer conversion in explore
- Remove \\r and special characters from strings in r_data and r_state 
- Fix sorting in _R > Report_ for tables created using _Data > Pivot_ and _Data > Explore_ when column headers contain symbols or spaces (thanks @4kammer)
- Set `error = TRUE` for rmarkdown for consistency with knitr as used in R > Report
- Correctly handle decimal indicators when loading csv files in _Data > Manage_
- Don't overwrite a dataset to combine if combine generates an error when user sets the the name of the combined data to that of an already selected dataset
- When multiple variables were selected, data were not correctly summarized in Data > Transform
- Add (function) lable to bar plot when x-variable is an integer
- Maintain order of variables in Data > Visualize when using "color", "fill", "comby", or "combx"
- Avoid warning when switching datasets in Data > Transform and variables being summarized do not exists in the new dataset
- which.pmax produced a list but needed to be integer
- To customized predictions in radiant.model indexr must be able to customize the prediction dataframe
- describe now correctly resets the working directory on exit
- removed all calls to summarise_each and mutate_each from dplyr

## Deprecated
- varp_rm has been deprecated in favor of varpop 
- sdp_rm has been deprecated in favor of sdpop 
- mutate_each has been deprecated in favor of mutate_at, mutate_all, and radiant.data::mutate_ext
